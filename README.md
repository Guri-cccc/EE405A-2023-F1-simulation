# EE405 F1tenth Project (F1TENTH Racecar Simulator)
This project is based on F1TENTH Project.

[https://github.com/Leedk3/EE405_a_eurecar_f1_tenth_project](https://github.com/Leedk3/EE405_a_eurecar_f1_tenth_project)

This project is based on F1TENTH Project.
Please refer to the following site:

[https://f1tenth.org/](https://f1tenth.org/)

[https://github.com/f1tenth-dev/simulator](https://github.com/f1tenth-dev/simulator)

Also, this project provides gazebo simulator and messages. 
Therefore, it is a proper environment to implement such as vehicle control, simple mapping, and localization algorithm. We hope you to try whatever you want to test in this simulator. 

As the class progresses, you can experience installing sensors required for algorithms in the vehicle and using them to integrate them into their own algorithms.
We can modifiy the origin f1tenth model for you to use a camera sensor with odometry. 
Finally, we will use the same track model as the students experimenting on a real vehicle basis.

## Install guide

### ROS

Until the last lesson, we have covered ROS installation and basic usage, so we will assume that have ```ros-noetic-desktop``` installed.

if you have not installed ```ros-noetic-desktop```, you can follow the instruction here:
[ROS-noetic-installation/Ubuntu](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)

Also, you can follow the documentation to start ROS and set the environment to use ros-command comfortably.
See this page: [ROS/StartGuide](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/StartGuide)

If you have ```ros-noetic-desktop``` installed, the additional dependencies you must install are:

- tf2_geometry_msgs
- ackermann_msgs
- joy
- map_server

You can install them by running:

    sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-tf2-geometry-msgs ros-noetic-ackermann-msgs ros-noetic-joy ros-noetic-map-server ros-noetic-teleop-twist-keyboard ros-noetic-navigation ros-noetic-teb-local-planner* ros-noetic-ros-control ros-noetic-ros-controllers ros-noetic-gazebo-ros-control ros-noetic-ackermann-msgs ros-noetic-serial qt4-default ros-noetic-effort-controllers

The full list of dependencies can be found in the ```package.xml``` file.

### Simulator package download

To install the simulator package, clone the repo with the simulator and starter code into your catkin workspace:

    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/Guri-cccc/EE405A-2023-F1-simulation.git
    
Personally, I installed the simulator package in the ```~/f1_ws``` because I have installed other packages in the ```~/catkin_ws```. If you want to separate the workspace as I did, you can make a new directory as I created.
As a result, I did: 

    cd ~/f1_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/Guri-cccc/EE405A-2023-F1-simulation.git
    cd EE405A-2023-F1-simulation
    git checkout noetic



<!-- ### For gazebo environment
The source for the required packages, including the simulator, are now in the workspace. The simulator depends on the GPU particle filter developed by the MIT RACECAR team and this package has to be configured before compiling the ROS packages. Navigate to the ```range_libc``` folder to compile the library necessary for the particle filter. Open a new terminal and enter the following commands:

    pip2 install --user cython

We checked that Cython version 0.29.24 is compatible. Try installing with 

    pip2 install --user cython==0.29.24

If you have problem installing with 

    ./compile.sh

in the next step
There are two methods for installing the particle filter; with GPU support and without GPU support. We recommend using the package with GPU support, but leave the decision to you.

**Installing with GPU Support**  
Keep this terminal open and pay special attention to the next step. The particle filter package depends heavily on the GPU and its architecture, so it becomes very important to match the architecture of the GPU in your local machine to the one listed in the configuration of `setup.py`. 

    ~/f1_ws/src/range_libc/pywrapper
    gedit setup.py

We are particularly interested in the `sm_xx` value associated with the GPU and more information can be found in this [article](https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/) which is a good reference for understanding types NVIDIA's GPU. Once the architecture type has been identified, go back to the terminal and open the setup file using an editor of your choice and navigate to line 96:

```python
nvcc_flags = ['-arch=sm_20', '--ptxas-options=-v', '-c', '--compiler-options', "'-fPIC'", "-w","-std=c++11"]
```

Replace `-arch=sm_20` with the `-arch=sm_xx` value from the article in the link provided above. Personally, I use NVIDIA 2080 GPU, I have changed it `-arch=sm_75`. Once you have made the changes, save the file and exit back to the terminal and enter the following command to compile the library and follow the instruction on the screen:

    ~/f1_ws/src/range_libc/pywrapper
    ./compile_with_cuda.sh


**Installing without GPU Support**  
In the same terminal, enter the following command and follow the instructions in the screen:


    ./compile.sh

### Simulator package installation    
Then run ```catkin_make``` to build it:

    cd ~/catkin_ws
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash

In my case, I worked in the ```f1_ws``` directory and I did:

    cd ~/f1_ws
    catkin_make
    source ~/f1_ws/devel/setup.bash

## Quick Start

### Run the simulator

For using customized world, you need to copy some files in ~/.gazebo/models (If you don't have the directory, run ```mkdir -p ~/.gazebo/models```).

For the race track environment (w/ and w/o obstacles), run the following commands 

    cp -r EE405_a_eurecar_f1_tenth_project/f1tenth-sim/world/race_track ~/.gazebo/models

You can change the gazebo world map by modifying the 'world_name' argument in the simulator.launch file ('race_track' or 'race_track_obstacles').

You can choose world with and without the obstacles.

To run the simulator on its own, run:

    roslaunch f1tenth-sim simulator.launch

This will launch everything you need for a full simulation; roscore, the simulator, a preselected map, a model of the racecar and the joystick server.

### Manually control the vehicle in the simulator

For manual control using your keyboard inputs, run this package:

```
user@ros-computer: rosrun f1tenth-sim keyboard_teleop.py car_1
```

Click the terminal where the keyboard_teleop node is running, and press your keyboards to control your vehicle.

- w a d s : forward, left, right, backward
- space_bar : brake 

### Sensor outputs
You can get RGB-pointcloud and image topics from realsense D435 from the simulation.

### Control imputs (direct control topic)
You can control the car in the simultor by publishing ```/car_1/command``` which is ```ackermann_msgs/AckermannDrive``` type.
You should control the car by giving ```steering_angle``` and ```speed``` values.
